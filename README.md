# Lab2
 Lab2 assignment for Algorithms and Data Structures course

 The task involved creating 2 basic List classes such as: MyArrayList and MyLinkedList which both implemented the given MyList interface
 The 2nd part of the task involved creating 3 more List classes that used previous to ease up the implementation 

 # Included Classes:
 MyArrayList
 MyLinkedList
 MyStack
 MyQueue
 MyMinHeap

 # Running the project:
 1. Clone and Open repository
 2. Build the project
 3. Run Main.java class to see the provided examples of all functionality

 The project demonstrates the implementation of various data structures such as ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, and MinHeap using Java. Each data structure is implemented from scratch without using built-in Java Collections Framework classes, except for the Iterator interface for iteration.

 The Main class contains examples of using each data structure, demonstrating their basic operations like insertion, deletion, and retrieval. By running the Main class, you can observe the functionality of each implemented data structure.
